## What I'm Proud Of

One of the aspects of this project that I'm particularly happy about is the ability to generate the HTML structure dynamically using JavaScript. This dynamic HTML generation not only makes the code more efficient but also enhances the flexibility of the game.

## Challenges Faced

While working on this project, one of the most challenging aspects for me was translating my conceptual thoughts into actual code. Converting the game's logic and rules into functional JavaScript code required careful planning and problem-solving. Overcoming these challenges was a valuable learning experience that improved my coding skills.

## How to Play

- Click on the cards to flip them.
- Try to find matching pairs of cards.
- Match all the pairs to win the game!
